Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition that affects communication, social interaction, and behavior.   
- Early detection = better intervention, improved outcomes. It plays a crucial role in improving life.
- Traditional diagnosis is time-consuming and expert-dependent.

Objective:
